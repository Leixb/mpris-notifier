## Features:

* **Dependency-light**: *mpris-notifier* tries to keep a fairly minimal dependency surface, where each dependency is [documented and justified in the Cargo.toml](https://github.com/l1na-forever/mpris-notifier/blob/mainline/Cargo.toml).
* **Compatibility**: *mpris-notifier* implements the [MPRIS2 Player specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) as well as the [XDG Desktop Notifications specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html), making it highly compatible among both media clients as well as notification daemons.
* **Customizability**: Most aspects of *mpris-notifier*'s behavior can be customized, particularly the format of the generated messages.

*mpris-notifier* is particularly useful for when..

* .. you run a headless music client, or a music client that doesn't natively emit desktop notifications (works great with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)!)
* .. you often switch between music clients, or run multiple music clients at once, and want consistent notifications without extra configuration (the same way [sxhkd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sxhkd) lets you reuse a hotkey configuration among multiple DEs)

## Installation

To install via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

    cargo install mpris-notifier

To install from source, first, [install Rust](https:://rustup.rs/), and then run:

    git clone github.com/l1na-forever/mpris-notifier
    cd mpris-notifier
    cargo install --path .

**Binary releases can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/l1na-forever/mpris-notifier/releases/).** To install a binary release, simply copy the executable to wherever's convenient (such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/.local/bin`), and run it!

## Usage

Typically, *mpris-notifier* is added to your desktop environment's start script (such as your `~/.xprofile`, or your window manager's configuration file). Add a line to run `mpris-notifier` somewhere in the script:

    mpris-notifier &

Upon first run, a configuration file with default values is generated at `~/.config/mpris-notifier/config.toml`. After customizing the configuration, restart `mpris-notifier`:

    pkill mpris-notifier; mpris-notifier &

Configuration keys are as follows:

* `subject_format`: Format string for the notification subject text.
* `body_format`: Format string for the notification message text.
* `join_string`: For fields including multiple entities (such as "artists"), this determines which character is used to join the strings.
* `enable_album_art`: Enable album artwork fetch. When enabled, album artwork will appear alongside the album art, provided that the art fetch completes within the deadline.
* `album_art_deadline`: The deadline, in milliseconds, before which the album art fetch must complete, else the notification will be sent without artwork.

## Troubleshooting

**mpris-notifier fails to start**

Make sure that the environment you're starting `mpris-notifier` from has a session D-Bus available. You can verify this by running `dbus-monitor` from the same context as with `mpris-notifier`.

**mpris-notifier doesn't emit notifications**

First, verify that your notification daemon is working as expected by sending a notification from the same environment as `mpris-notifier`:

    notify-send test # or dunstify test

Next, verify that MPRIS player properties signals are being emitted. Monitor the session D-Bus for the MPRIS signal, ensure lines are logged as the track changes:

    dbus-monitor | grep PlaybackStatus

If both above steps succeed but *mpris-notifier* isn't emitting notifications, [please file an issue](https://github.com/l1na-forever/mpris-notifier/issues/new/choose) üõ†Ô∏è ü©π.

## Status

`mpris-notifier` is mostly complete for my purposes, though I'll add small features as I need them. If there's an enhancement you'd like to see implemented (or would like to contribute ü•∫), [please file an issue](https://github.com/l1na-forever/mpris-notifier/issues/new/choose).
